<h2>Software - Introduction: </h2>
<p>As we know stand alone hardware cannot do nothing, for the smooth operation of our Computer System there should be proper coordination between hardware and software. Software helps to mobilize the hardware and other  resources. In order to mobilize hardware we have to write several set of instruction which instruct computer  what to do, what not o. These set of instruction are collectively know as program and the term software is the collection of related programs and  associated documents. In Order to produce useful output, hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be done with the hardware only and software cannot be utilize without hardware. The different types of software are:
</p>
<ul class="no-bullets">
<li>1) System software: System software is set of one or more programs designed to control the operation of our computer system. This type of software doesn't fulfill the specific requirement of the user. They are general program written to assist human in the use of the computer system. In general system software support the running of other software, communicate with peripheral device, support the development of other types of software and monitors the use of various hardware resources. Thus, the system software makes the operation of the computer system more effective and efficient. The system software is categorized into two categories.
</li> <br>
<li>1.1) System Management: It is responsible for proper management and functioning of the computers system. All types of management between computer hardware and software is performed by system management software. There are 3 types of system management software:
</li> <br>
<li>1.1.1) Operating System: Operating system is a collection program that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It is the 1st program that is loaded into memory when the computer is turned on. It provides platform for other application program to run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that uses can easily communicate with computer. For example Linux, Windows, Mac etc
</li> <br>
<li>1.1.2) Utility software: It is the supporting software which is used to perform specific task related to the maintenance of the computer system. Some  of the utility software are included in operating system where as some are available as separate utility in market. They are also called service program. For example  Norton Utility, PC tools, win zip etc
</li> <br>
<li>1.1.3) Device driver: A device driver is a software which is responsible for smooth functioning of the hardware device that is connected to the computer. When we add a new  device to the computer, we need to install new software called device driver. Device driver will co-ordinate with the operating system and the newly installed hardware functions properly and smoothly.
</li> <br>
<li>1.2) System Development: It refers to set of programs that are use to develop computer program. This type of software are not used by a normal user of the computes. They are used by programmers for the development of new program. There are two types of system development software:
</li> <br>
<li>1.2.1) Programming language: The language with which we give instruction to the computer is known as programming language. Programming language are the set of different keywords, variable, operators, loops and other symbols etc. They help to make communication between computer and user. These are two types of programming language low level language and high level language.
</li> <br>
<li>1.2.2) Language translator: It is a special kind computer software which translates the programs written one language in another language. It is compulsory for both low and high level language. It is also called language processor. The types of language translator are compiler, interpreter  and assembler.
</li> <br>
<li>2) Application Software:  Application software is a set of one or more program which are design to do a specific task. It is made to fulfill the user demand. This program directs a computer to solve user oriented problem such as preparing bills,  calculating mathematical equation, preparing mark sheet etc. The software that are develop for user purpose is called application software.These types of software are generally develop by using high level language. for example Ms-Excel, Photoshop, Billing software etc. There are two types of application software.
</li> <br>
 <li>2.1) Packaged software: They are the generalized set of programs design and develop for general purpose. It is generally large sized, error-free, advance and standard software with much more functionality fir especial work. This type of software doesn't perfectly match the requirement of many organization or user. They cannot be changed easily are developed and designed by reputed software Company so they are trust worthy. They are expensive for small organization. for example Ms-Office, Adobe, Macromedia etc.
</li> <br>
<li>2.2) Customized /Tailored software: This is a software develop in high level language for special task. This types of software is developed for some specific purpose for solving specific problem of specific user or organization. The requirement on the user or organization can be perfectly matched. They can be changed easily since they are made by local programmer. for example: payroll system, inventory management, school management, billing software, mark sheet evaluation etc.
</li> <br>
</ul>
<h2>Operating system - Introduction</h2>
<p>An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of program that controls overall resources such as CPU, memory, input-output device of the computer system. The major objective of operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The operating system provides the platform for other application program/software to run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that user can easily communicate with computers, which is more convenient to use and operate.

An operating system is a collection of program that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It also controls and co-ordinate the use of hardware, among the various application program for various user. So, it act as an interface between user and the computer hardware. The other major functions of operating system are:

<ul class="formatforul">
<li>It controls, monitor and co-ordinate overall operation of our computer system.</li>
<li>It act as an interface between user and computer.</li>
<li>It provide platform to develop, run and execute other computer program.</li>
<li>It manages hardware resources such as CPU,  memories, input-output terminals, networking equipment etc.</li>
<li>It hides programming and hardware complexity to the user.</li>
</ul> 
  The primary goal of an operating system is to maximize the productivity of a computer system by operating it in most efficient manner and maintaining the amount of human intervention. Some example of operating system are: MS-DOS, Windows, LINUX, MACOS, UNIX, Chrome, Fedora, Ubuntu etc.

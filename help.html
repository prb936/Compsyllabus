<h1 id="chap1"> Computer System </h1>


<h2>What is a computer system? </h2>
A computer system is an integrated set of hardware and software designed to process data and perform computations. The hardware includes physical components like the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, input devices (such as keyboards and mice), and output devices (like monitors and printers). The software comprises the operating system, application programs, and utilities that instruct the hardware on how to operate. Together, these elements work cohesively to execute tasks and manage information efficiently.

<h2>What are the main components of a computer system?</h2>
The primary components of a computer system are:

Central Processing Unit (CPU): Acts as the brain of the computer, performing calculations and executing instructions.

Memory: Stores data and instructions temporarily (RAM) or permanently (ROM).

Input Devices: Allow users to interact with the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse).

Output Devices: Enable the computer to communicate information to the user (e.g., monitor, printer).

Storage Devices: Provide long-term data storage (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).

Bus: A collection of wires used to transfer data between different components, facilitating communication within the system.

<h2>How does a computer understand programs written in high-level languages?</h2>
Computers interpret programs written in high-level languages through the use of translators such as compilers and interpreters. These tools convert high-level code, which is human-readable, into machine language that the computer's CPU can execute. A compiler translates the entire program at once, creating an executable file, while an interpreter converts code line-by-line during execution. This process enables the computer to process complex instructions efficiently.

<h2>Why is the execution time of machine code less than that of source code? </h2>
Machine code consists of binary instructions directly understood by the CPU, allowing for rapid execution. In contrast, source code written in high-level languages requires translation by compilers or interpreters before execution. This translation adds an extra step, resulting in longer processing times compared to executing pre-translated machine code. Therefore, programs running in machine code typically execute faster than those running from source code.


<h1 id="chap2"> Number system and Boolean Logic </h1>


<h2>What are number systems, and why are they important in computing? </h2>
Number systems are methods for representing numbers using a consistent set of digits or symbols. They are crucial in computing because computers use binary (base-2) number systems to perform calculations. Understanding different number systems, such as binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal, allows for effective communication and conversion between human-readable data and machine-readable data. In computing, binary is used at the hardware level, while hexadecimal and octal are often used to simplify binary representations for human understanding.

<h2>What is the binary number system?</h2>
The binary number system is a base-2 number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is the fundamental system used by computers for processing data. Each binary digit is called a bit, and a group of eight bits is called a byte. Binary numbers are used in digital electronics and computer systems to represent data and execute instructions, as the hardware components, such as transistors, have two states: on (1) and off (0).

<h2>How do you convert a decimal number to binary? </h2>
To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2, recording the remainders at each step. The binary equivalent is the sequence of remainders, written in reverse order. For example, to convert the decimal number 13 to binary:
13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1
6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
Thus, 13 in decimal is 1101 in binary.

<h2>What is the two’s complement method, and how is it used for binary subtraction?</h2>
The two’s complement method is a way of representing negative numbers in binary. To find the two’s complement of a binary number, first invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s), then add 1 to the result. This method simplifies binary subtraction, as subtracting a number is equivalent to adding its two’s complement. For example, to subtract 3 from 5 in binary, find the two’s complement of 3 and add it to 5.
